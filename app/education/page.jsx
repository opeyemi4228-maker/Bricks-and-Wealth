// ─── UK Property Basics — fundamental concepts ───────────────────────────────
const BASICS_CONCEPTS = [
  {
    icon: HomeIcon,
    title: "Freehold vs Leasehold",
    short: "Two ways to own UK property",
    body: "Freehold means you own the property and the land outright, indefinitely. Leasehold means you own the right to live in the property for a fixed period (often 99–999 years), with the land owned by a freeholder. Most flats in England & Wales are leasehold; most houses are freehold.",
    keyPoint: "B&W typically buys freehold houses or long-leasehold flats with 100+ years remaining.",
  },
  {
    icon: PieChart,
    title: "Yield vs Capital Growth",
    short: "The two ways property earns money",
    body: "Rental yield is the annual rent expressed as a percentage of property value — your income return. Capital growth is the increase in property value over time — your equity return. Total return = yield + capital growth, before costs and tax.",
    keyPoint: "B&W targets 7–11% yield SPVs, with capital growth as a secondary benefit.",
  },
  {
    icon: Coins,
    title: "Stamp Duty & Costs",
    short: "What you actually pay beyond the purchase price",
    body: "Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) applies to most UK property purchases. Rates rise with property value, with surcharges for second homes and overseas buyers. Other costs include legal fees, surveys, and lender fees — typically 3–6% of purchase price in total.",
    keyPoint: "All costs are included in SPV models — you only fund your subscription amount.",
  },
  {
    icon: TrendingUp,
    title: "The UK Property Cycle",
    short: "Why timing the market is harder than time in market",
    body: "UK property has historically risen ~5–7% annually over rolling 10-year periods, with cycles of expansion and correction. Regional variation matters: Manchester, Leeds, and Birmingham have outperformed London since 2017 by significant margins.",
    keyPoint: "B&W focuses on regional growth markets, not London prime — where yield + growth align.",
  },
  {
    icon: Wrench,
    title: "Repairs, Voids & Management",
    short: "The unglamorous costs that erode returns",
    body: "Real-world rental income is always lower than gross rent. Allow ~10% for management fees, ~5% for void periods (empty between tenants), and ~10% for repairs and maintenance. A 12% gross yield often becomes a 7–8% net yield after these.",
    keyPoint: "B&W modelled yields are NET — already adjusted for these realities.",
  },
  {
    icon: FileText,
    title: "Tax on Property Income",
    short: "How rental income and gains are taxed in the UK",
    body: "Rental income from a UK property held in a Limited Company is taxed at corporation tax rates (currently 19–25%). When the SPV sells the property, capital gains are also taxed. Distributions to investors are then dividend income, taxed at your personal rate.",
    keyPoint: "B&W's structure is tax-efficient for company profits, but not advice — speak to your accountant.",
  },
];

// ─── Buy-to-Let topics ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
const BTL_TOPICS = [
  {
    label: "Strategy",
    title: "What is Buy-to-Let?",
    body: "Buy-to-Let (BTL) is the practice of purchasing residential property specifically to rent out, rather than to live in. It generates rental income (yield) and may appreciate in value (capital growth). It is the most common UK property investment strategy.",
  },
  {
    label: "Yield",
    title: "How yields are calculated",
    body: "Gross yield = annual rent ÷ property value × 100. So a £200,000 property rented at £1,250/month earns £15,000/year — a 7.5% gross yield. Net yield subtracts management, repairs, void costs, and tax — typically 1.5–3 percentage points lower.",
  },
  {
    label: "Tenants",
    title: "Tenant types & risk profiles",
    body: "Professional tenants (single occupancy, AST contracts) offer stability. Family tenants offer the longest tenures. Student lets and HMOs offer higher gross yields but more management complexity. B&W matches tenant strategy to property type and location.",
  },
  {
    label: "Voids",
    title: "Void periods explained",
    body: "A void is a period when the property is empty between tenants. Even a 4-week void per year reduces gross yield by ~8%. Good location, well-maintained property, and competitive pricing minimise voids — and a 5–8% void allowance is built into every B&W model.",
  },
  {
    label: "Management",
    title: "Self-managed vs agency",
    body: "Direct management means dealing with tenants, repairs, and inspections yourself — no fee, but significant time and expertise required. Letting agents charge 8–15% of rent for full management. All B&W SPVs use vetted managing agents — the cost is in the model.",
  },
  {
    label: "Mortgages",
    title: "BTL mortgages & leverage",
    body: "BTL mortgages typically require 25–40% deposit, with higher interest rates than residential mortgages. Most B&W SPVs use ~70% LTV mortgages — the lower the LTV, the lower the risk. Rising rates compress margins, which is why fixed-rate products are preferred.",
  },
];

// ─── FTB Status FAQ ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
const FTB_FAQS = [
  {
    q: "If I invest in a B&W SPV, do I lose my UK first-time buyer status?",
    a: "No. You become a shareholder in a Limited Company that owns property — you do not personally own UK property. UK first-time buyer rules under the Stamp Duty Land Tax framework define a first-time buyer as someone who has never owned a residential property in their own name (or jointly), anywhere in the world. Owning shares in a property-holding SPV is not the same as owning property in your name.",
    icon: ShieldCheck,
  },
  {
    q: "What about overseas property I already own — does that affect B&W?",
    a: "Owning property overseas (in your name) does affect your UK first-time buyer eligibility regardless of B&W. If preserving FTB status is critical, speak to an accountant before committing. Investing in B&W SPVs does not, on its own, change your FTB status — but other property holdings might.",
    icon: Globe,
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from buying a property directly?",
    a: "When you buy property directly, your name appears on HM Land Registry as the legal owner — at which point you cease to be a first-time buyer for SDLT purposes. With a B&W SPV, the SPV company appears on Land Registry. You appear on the SPV's cap table as a shareholder. Different legal positions, different tax treatments.",
    icon: FileText,
  },
  {
    q: "Will Brick & Wealth confirm this in writing?",
    a: "Yes. Every subscription pack includes a structural summary and risk acknowledgement that explains how shareholding differs from direct ownership. We always recommend you have your own legal and tax advisor review your specific situation — and we can refer you to independent solicitors familiar with the B&W structure.",
    icon: CheckCircle2,
  },
  {
    q: "What if I plan to buy my own home in the next 5 years?",
    a: "You can typically continue investing in B&W SPVs alongside saving for your own home purchase. The two are not mutually exclusive. When you eventually buy your own residence, your B&W shareholdings remain in place. Plan with your accountant to ensure timing works for your personal goals.",
    icon: HomeIcon,

              Most BTL marketing focuses on gross yield. We focus on net yield —
              what you actually take home after management, voids, and repairs.
              The difference is significant, and understanding it is the
              difference between investing well and being surprised.
